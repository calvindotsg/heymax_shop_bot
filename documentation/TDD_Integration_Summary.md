## 🚀 **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**

### **9-Stage Quality Pipeline**

1. **Setup** - Environment validation and dependency caching
2. **Lint** - Code quality and TypeScript compilation
3. **Unit Tests** - Component-level TDD validation with coverage
4. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end workflow validation
5. **Performance Tests** - Load testing and benchmark validation
6. **Security** - Vulnerability scanning and secret detection
7. **Build Test** - Deployment configuration validation
8. **Quality Gate** - Aggregate results and coverage validation
9. **Deploy** - Automated staging deployment with verification

### **Automated Quality Gates**

- **Coverage Gate**: Fails if <80% overall or <90% critical components
- **Performance Gate**: Fails if >1 second response time or memory limits
  exceeded
- **Security Gate**: Fails if secrets detected or known vulnerabilities found
- **Integration Gate**: Fails if any end-to-end workflow broken
- **Deployment Gate**: Fails if staging deployment or health checks fail

## 🔧 **Implementation Examples**

### **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle Example**

```typescript
// RED: Write failing test first
Deno.test("InlineQuery: handleInlineQuery_ValidMerchantSearch_ReturnsResults", async () => {
  const result = await handleInlineQuery(inlineQuery, testClient);
  assertEquals(result.method, "answerInlineQuery");
  assert(result.results.length > 0);
});

// GREEN: Minimal implementation to pass test
export async function handleInlineQuery(inlineQuery: any, client: any) {
  return {
    method: "answerInlineQuery",
    inline_query_id: inlineQuery.id,
    results: [{ type: "article", id: "test", title: "Test" }],
  };
}

// REFACTOR: Improve code quality while maintaining test coverage
export async function handleInlineQuery(inlineQuery: any, client: any) {
  const query = sanitizeQuery(inlineQuery.query);
  const merchants = await searchMerchants(query, client);
  return createInlineQueryResponse(inlineQuery.id, merchants);
}
```
