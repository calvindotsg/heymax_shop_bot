# MVP Implementation Workflow Summary

## 3-Sprint Agile Approach (2-3 weeks)

### Sprint 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (Week 1)
**Focus**: Database, Supabase setup, Telegram webhook
- Database schema with users, merchants, link_generations tables
- Supabase Edge Function framework for webhook handling  
- Telegram bot registration with inline query support
- Seed merchant dataset (20+ popular merchants)
**Effort**: 4.5 days (40% time saving through parallel execution)

### Sprint 2: Core Bot Functionality (Week 2) 
**Focus**: Inline queries, affiliate links, user tracking
- Inline query processing with fuzzy merchant search
- Affiliate link generation with user ID tracking + UTM parameters
- User registration and activity tracking
- Bot response formatting with engaging messages
**Effort**: 5.5 days (25% time saving through parallel execution)

### Sprint 3: Viral Mechanics & Launch (Week 3)
**Focus**: Viral buttons, analytics, production deployment
- "Get MY Unique Link" button functionality for viral loops
- Analytics dashboard with viral coefficient tracking
- Load testing for 100+ concurrent users
- Production deployment with monitoring
- Launch materials and user onboarding
**Effort**: 6 days (30% time saving through parallel execution)

## Key Success Metrics
- **Technical**: <1s response time, >99% uptime, <1% error rate
- **Business**: 500+ links/month, 1.2+ viral coefficient, 50+ daily active users
- **Free Tier**: <400K function calls/month (80% of Supabase limit)

## Risk Management
- Free tier limit monitoring (80% threshold alerts)
- Rate limiting (100 requests/hour per user)
- Performance optimization with database indexing
- Clear upgrade path to Supabase Pro ($25/month)

## Technical Implementation
- **Single Edge Function**: Handles all bot logic (TypeScript/Deno)
- **PostgreSQL Schema**: Optimized for free tier constraints
- **Viral Mechanics**: Callback queries trigger new user interactions
- **Analytics**: Track user engagement and viral growth
