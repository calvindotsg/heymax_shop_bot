# Session: Max Miles Messaging Improvements & Documentation

## Session Summary
**Date**: 2025-08-29
**Primary Task**: Add "up to" qualifier to all Max Miles mentions throughout the codebase
**Secondary Task**: CLAUDE.md creation for future instances

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Max Miles Messaging Enhancement
- **Scope**: Updated all Max Miles references to include "up to" qualifier
- **Files Modified**:
  - `supabase/functions/telegram-bot/index.ts` (main bot logic)
  - `tests/unit/telegram-bot.test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/telegram-bot-sprint2.test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/telegram-bot-sprint3.test.ts`

### 2. Specific Changes Made
- Inline query results: `"Earn up to ${merchant.base_mpd} Max Miles per $1"`
- Bot responses: `"Earn up to ${earnRate} Max Miles per $1"`
- Example calculations: `"Earn up to ${exampleEarnings} Max Miles"`
- Top earner descriptions: `"Top earner: up to ${merchant.base_mpd} Max Miles per $1"`
- Viral messaging: `"earn up to Max Miles at ${merchant.merchant_name}"`

### 3. CLAUDE.md Documentation
- **Created**: Comprehensive development guide for future Claude Code instances
- **Contents**: 
  - Project overview and architecture
  - File structure and key locations
