# Session: GitHub Workflow Cleanup - 2025-09-02

## Completed Tasks

### Removed Components
1. **Job 4: Integration Tests with Database**
   - Removed entire `integration-tests` job from `.github/workflows/tdd-pipeline.yml`
   - Deleted `tests/integration/` directory with 5 test files:
     - `database.test.ts`
     - `telegram-api.test.ts`
     - `edge-function.test.ts`
     - `viral-flow.test.ts`
     - `run-tests.ts`
     - `test-config.ts`

2. **Job 5: Performance Tests**
   - Removed entire `performance-tests` job from workflow
   - Deleted `tests/performance/` directory with:
     - `performance-validation.test.ts`
     - `load-test-config.yml`

3. **Job 9: Auto-deployment**
   - Removed entire `deploy` job and staging deployment logic
   - Removed Supabase staging environment configuration
   - Updated language from "deployment" to "release" in quality reports

### Updated Dependencies
- Updated `quality-gate` job to remove `integration-tests` and `performance-tests` dependencies
- Updated `build-test` job to remove `integration-tests` dependency
- Fixed PR comment script to remove integration and performance test status reporting
- Updated quality gate validation logic to focus on unit tests, security, and build tests only

### Final Workflow Structure
**Setup** → **Lint** → **Unit Tests** → **Security** → **Build Test** → **Quality Gate** → **PR Comment**

## Technical Notes
- Workflow now focuses on core unit testing and security validation
- Removed external dependencies on Supabase staging environment
- Simplified CI/CD pipeline for faster execution
- Maintained code quality gates and coverage requirements

## Impact Assessment
- Reduced CI/CD execution time by removing database and performance testing stages
- Simplified workflow maintenance and reduced external dependencies
- Preserved core quality gates (unit tests, security, build validation)
- Removed staging deployment automation (manual deployment required)
